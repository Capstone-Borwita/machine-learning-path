# Result Summary

OCR is refer to optical character recognition, the objective of this model is to make text generated based on image contain text. Several model already deployed on python library, in this case we compare many library that can be used in python , there are Pytesseract, EasyOCR, PyOCR. This 3 model were develop by many type of font and has similar framework model with our model (Use CNN-RNN and CTC decode). While, our model focussed on font used in KTP id card. So here summary of the result with use of 55 image.
